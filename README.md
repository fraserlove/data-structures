# Data Structures
A data structures library implemented in C++ that features commonly found structures such as queues, stacks, singly linked lists and dynamic arrays. The library has been designed so that the data structures are independent of any c++ standard or third-party library. Data structures have been designed to build upon previous structures, for example the priority queue is implemented using the library's own dynamic array class. 

The time complexities of each structure's operations are included alongside the methodâ€™s declaration in the structures header class. Within each data structures folder is a Main.cpp file which is not a dependency to create the data structure but provides a console system to easily create and modify the relevant data structure for testing. All data structures were designed and implemented by Fraser Love - me@fraser.love.

## Included Data Structures with Underlying Data Structure Implementation
  - Dynamic Array (Static Arrays)
  - Singly Linked List
  - Stack (Singly Linked List)
  - Queue (Singly Linked List)
  - Priority Queue (Binary Heaps / Dynamic Array)
