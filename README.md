# Data Structures
A data structures library implemented in C++ that features commonly found structures such as queues, stacks, singly linked lists and dynamic arrays. The library has been designed so that the data structures are independant on any c++ standard or third-party library. Data structres have been designed to build upon previous structues, for example the priority queue is implemented using the libraries own dynamic array class. 

The time complexities of each structures operations are included alongside the methods decleration in the structures header class. Within each data structures folder is a Main.cpp file which is not a dependancy to create the data structure but provides an console system to easily create and modify the relavent data structure for testing. All data structures were designed and implemented by Fraser Love - me@fraser.love.

## Included Data Structures with Underlying Data Structure Implementation
  - Dynamic Array (Static Arrays)
  - Singly Linked List
  - Stack (Singly Linked List)
  - Queue (Singly Linked List)
  - Priority Queue (Binary Heaps / Dynamic Array)
